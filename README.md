About Set Creator
This is my first C# app, so please, be forgiving :)
Before every gig with my band, we had to chose songs we would play. Chosing songs, we had to be careful not to exceed the time limit.
Doing it manually wasn't very convinient, so I came up with idea for this app.

Features:
  - Record library
    Add your songs to the library and export the library to JSON file, so you can use it in the future.
  - Setlist
    Add songs of your choice from your library to the setlist, control setlist time.
    Manage song order in the setlist.
    Export/import your setlist to JSON, so you can use it in the future.
    Save your setlist to txt or pdf file.
